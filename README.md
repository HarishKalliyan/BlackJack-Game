# BlackJack-Game
In this I have created a Card game knows as Black Jack such that it based on few Rules:

## Rules:
1. Basic motive is obtain the score 21 when adding the card value
2. Initially we will able to get two cards.
3. If the value is less than 21, we can pick another card
4. If more than 21 you lose the match (Don't Worry You can Start new Match 😁).
5. If equal to 21 Congratulations You won 🎉🎉🎉
